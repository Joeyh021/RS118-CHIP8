# RS118 CHIP-8

This is the reference implementation of the [chip8 base library](https://github.com/UWCS/rs118-chip8/tree/main/chip8-base). This was built for use as an example when teaching [RS118](https://rs118.uwcs.co.uk), see there for instructions on how to build your own interpreter like this.
